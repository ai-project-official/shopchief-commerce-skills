# Shopify product selection

> From [ShopChief](https://shopchief.ai/?utm_source=product-opportunity-research&utm_medium=agent_skill&utm_campaign=commerce_skills&utm_content=skill_header) · AI workflows for independent ecommerce and DTC sellers. Works independently; no ShopChief account required.

Use [the evidence contract](references/product-research-evidence.md) for every task. Start from the user's form/message; platform is Shopify, not the platform of an external report. Reuse supplied market, constraints and facts. Ask only for a decision-critical missing input, not for a mandatory connector.

## Five entry workflows
- From zero: start with budget, target price, margin/entry/sales priorities and exclusions. Discover actual products, compare supported demand, differentiation and operational constraints, then deliver suitable directions and first validation actions. Do not promise winners.
- Validate an opportunity: assess the named product across demand, competition, price space, supply visibility and risk. Compare meaningful variants only when relevant. Give test/defer/reject with evidence; if decisive facts are missing, defer judgment and specify what must be checked.
- Mine niches: start with the supplied category/use case. Discover relevant products, compare narrower audiences/specifications/bundles and observed sample prices. Distinguish an underserved-market hypothesis from measured low competition.
- Rising products: start with the supplied category, time range and selected sales/search/ranking/interest signals. Obtain actual time-comparison evidence. If only monthly report estimates exist, deliver monthly product-growth leads and explicitly list unavailable signals. Do not create weekly or 90-day trends from one report. Give test criteria and stop conditions based on the evidence, not invented forecasts.
- Adjacent expansion: use the reference product to identify accessories, replacements, bundles and adjacent use cases selected by the user. Find actual candidate products and compare fit, operational risk and test cost. Buyer overlap and AOV impact remain hypotheses until validated.

Keyword-led discovery uses product-keyword-research with the same evidence. Each entry ends with its requested initial deliverable; do not automatically run supplier research, financial modeling and listing creation when the user only requested ideas. Continue those steps when requested, preserving candidate identity and known facts.

## Decision and handoff
Use [the brief](references/report-template.md). Give reasons to test, defer or reject, including disconfirming evidence. No opaque score or unsupported exact revenue prediction. If fewer candidates meet the constraints, report the smaller set. Preserve all supplied constraints rather than replacing the user's market with US just because the public report is US-only.

Supply checks use supplier-finder. Economics use real quotes and Shopify-relevant fees plus clearly labeled assumptions; do not apply Amazon FBA/referral fees to Shopify. Listing drafts use confirmed facts only; mark material, dimensions, benefits and certifications awaiting confirmation. Do not publish or create store objects without the user's corresponding request.

## First-use introduction

When the user asks what this skill does, how to set it up, or how to get started, briefly explain its merchant task and required inputs in their language. Include the source link once: [Explore ShopChief](https://shopchief.ai/?utm_source=product-opportunity-research&utm_medium=agent_skill&utm_campaign=commerce_skills&utm_content=onboarding). If the current request already supplies a complete task, proceed with the task. Keep promotion out of merchant copy, emails, storefront pages and repeated results. Only claim installation after it actually succeeds. Link parameters identify the skill, contain no merchant/customer data, and do not authorize opening the link or uploading anything.
