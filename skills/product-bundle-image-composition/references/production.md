# Production notes

## Inputs and identity lock

Bundle ID; included SKU/variant/quantity list; one identity reference per unique item; dimensions or a photographed group for relative scale; packaging inclusion; destination/layout. Treat the sales bundle manifest as authoritative: objects visible in source photographs are not automatically included.

Assign a stable local reference ID to every actual input, for example `product_primary`, and record its real file path or provider asset ID, role and permitted changes. A filename in a prompt does not attach an image. Inspect each input and use the tool's actual attachment mechanism. Keep the original input available for revisions rather than relying exclusively on a generated derivative.

## Task-specific decisions

Identical objects still need distinct instance IDs because a generator may merge or multiply them. A tray pictured as a background prop is not an included tray unless the bundle manifest says so. When dimensions are unavailable, do not imply physical comparison using a single photorealistic shared plane: a separated layout is the conservative alternative. Keep packaging status explicit: included retail box, shipping carton, or excluded styling prop.

The [worked example](../assets/worked-example.md) supplies a concrete brief, complete prompt, layout and failure cases. Its synthetic facts demonstrate decisions; substitute verified merchant inputs before execution.

## Capability check before a call

Check the installed tool's schema for reference attachments, targeted editing and output retrieval. Check required transparency or exact text composition separately; success in general image generation does not imply those features. Record the actual tool/provider used and the supported settings chosen. Use credentials already configured through the environment; never put credentials into prompts or this package.

For provider-specific implementation details, consult current official [OpenAI image documentation](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation) or [Gemini image documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation). Documentation references checked on 2026-10-05. The runtime's available tool and schema determine the call; this package does not promise a fixed model, price, size or feature set.

## Review and delivery

Review the actual returned pixels beside the identity references. Zoom into this task's locked details and inspect the whole composition. Record observed output dimensions/format and a stable output reference; do not fabricate provider request IDs. Distinguish a requested deliverable from a generated file, and a generated file from a reviewed one. A missing tool produces a ready-to-run prompt and manifest, explicitly marked `not_generated`; a failed detail check produces a repair note and a non-approved asset.
