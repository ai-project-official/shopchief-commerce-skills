# Production execution

## Timing and localization mechanics

Keep three distinct records: source transcript with source time, translated utterance IDs, and final audio/caption time. A source cue ending at 4.0 seconds does not force its translation to end there. Measure each target recording; align with an available speech alignment tool or by listening and scrubbing. Where no aligner exists, manual timing is valid if checked against the full audio.

For a dubbed cut, keep voice, music and effects on separate tracks when sources allow it. Removing source speech from a mixed master may damage the soundtrack; inspect before accepting and prefer supplied stems. Preserve essential product-operation sounds. Avoid clipping by listening to the combined mix rather than assuming a fixed gain is universally suitable.

For subtitles, create actual SRT/VTT cues only after timing is established. Check cue ordering, no accidental negative duration, sensible line breaks and coverage of qualifications. A UTF-8 caption file may still fail in the target renderer if the chosen font lacks needed glyphs; preview the real export for every language.

Render each requested locale and inspect metadata plus full audio. When a target platform imposes specific codec/caption rules, verify its current export documentation. Do not invent hardcoded cross-platform limits. Keep the locale in the filenames and in the export manifest so variants cannot be mistaken for one another.

## Tool capability and execution record

These are original production instructions, not an SDK integration or a promise that a generator is installed. Inspect the tools actually available, their input schema, authentication state, output access and current provider documentation. Match the requested media operation to observed support: image conditioning, speech, lip-sync, frame controls, editing and rendering are separate capabilities. Use the user's chosen provider where it can satisfy the task; do not silently replace it.

Before a paid request, retain the existing authorized quantity and budget in the production manifest. When the user already authorized the operation, proceed within those limits. If essential pricing or a maximum cost is genuinely unknown, clarify that missing boundary rather than inventing a price. A failed or rejected candidate can still consume provider credits. Do not generate extra assets merely because the tool supports batching.

For an asynchronous generation: save the task/operation identifier as soon as it exists; record the source references, request, candidate number and creation time without credentials. Await/poll through the provider's supported status mechanism and reasonable polling cadence. A client timeout means unknown outcome unless the provider confirms otherwise. Resume the same identifier; do not blindly resubmit or spend another credit. If the creation response was lost before an ID was received, use supported request/task history or idempotency recovery where available. Otherwise report unresolved submission and stop further paid retries until the original status can be established. Keep partial outputs and explicit per-task states.

When a task succeeds, use the available authorized save/download path, record its local artifact or durable output reference and inspect the bytes. A successful API state alone does not prove a playable, correct video. Do not expose credentials or signed asset URLs in public manifests.

## Media checks when local tools are available

Use the actual editor/exporter available in the environment. For a local video, `ffprobe` can inspect container metadata without modifying the file:

```sh
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration:stream=index,codec_type,codec_name,width,height,avg_frame_rate,sample_rate,channels -of json output.mp4
```

`output.mp4` is a user-created output path placeholder, not a bundled file. Confirm the program is installed before invoking it. Inspect decoded frames or use a compatible player and listen to audio. Metadata inspection is not visual QA. A composition/project file is not a video export. If no preview capability exists, report the file as rendered but visually unverified rather than claiming acceptance.

Use specific statuses such as `not generated`, `submitted`, `running`, `failed`, `generated but rejected`, `rendered but unverified` and `accepted`. Deliver the full prompt/script and source-bound specifications for blocked work so it can be resumed; mark media absent where no file was produced. Asset creation does not include publishing, ad activation or uploading unrelated private files.
