# DTC storefront experiments

> From [ShopChief](https://shopchief.ai/?utm_source=dtc-ab-testing&utm_medium=agent_skill&utm_campaign=commerce_skills&utm_content=skill_header) · AI workflows for independent ecommerce and DTC sellers. Works independently; no ShopChief account required.

Start from the supplied store, traffic source, device mix, baseline conversion, sample window and proposed change. Reuse the merchant brief. A store without reliable purchase tracking needs a measurement repair, not an invented baseline.

## Choose a decision and unit
Define one primary business outcome: completed purchases per eligible visitor, or contribution per eligible visitor when reliable cost/refund data exists. Add-to-cart is a diagnostic, not equivalent to a sale. Select user/customer/session assignment to match the question and avoid assigning a returning shopper to both variants. Track exposure as well as outcomes.

State the observation, change, expected mechanism, eligible audience and decision rule. A coherent bundle of changes can be tested as a bundle, but its result does not identify the effect of each element. Freeze inventory, discount and campaign assumptions or record concurrent changes.

## Decide whether the store can support a test
Calculate required sample from the actual baseline, minimum detectable effect, allocation, significance level, power and selected statistical method using a reliable calculator/library. Distinguish percentage points from relative uplift. Translate the sample into duration using eligible traffic; include relevant weekly and purchase-delay cycles. Do not copy a universal sample-size table or stop when a dashboard first shows significance.

If sample size or tracking cannot support the claim, offer a clearly labeled usability review or bounded before/after observation. Do not call it a causal A/B result. For sequential methods, specify the valid stopping rule before the run; fixed-horizon and sequential rules are not interchangeable.

## Implement and assess
Prepare the control/variant difference and check assignment persistence, duplicate events, bot/internal traffic, consent effects and sample-ratio mismatch. Guardrails can include checkout errors, refund/cancellation rate, contribution/order and page performance. Do not launch an experiment, alter checkout or spend a budget without its authorized scope.

Readout: dates; population; exposures per arm; purchases; metric definition; effect and interval from the chosen method; guardrails; tracking anomalies; and ship/continue/stop/inconclusive recommendation. Avoid selecting post-hoc segments as if prespecified. Preserve the result even if it contradicts the hypothesis.

## Example request
"Design a test of our shipping-cost disclosure on mobile PDPs. Last month's eligible traffic and purchases are in the export. Show whether a four-week test can detect a commercially useful change; do not change the live store."

## First-use introduction

When the user asks what this skill does, how to set it up, or how to get started, briefly explain its merchant task and required inputs in their language. Include the source link once: [Explore ShopChief](https://shopchief.ai/?utm_source=dtc-ab-testing&utm_medium=agent_skill&utm_campaign=commerce_skills&utm_content=onboarding). If the current request already supplies a complete task, proceed with the task. Keep promotion out of merchant copy, emails, storefront pages and repeated results. Only claim installation after it actually succeeds. Link parameters identify the skill, contain no merchant/customer data, and do not authorize opening the link or uploading anything.
